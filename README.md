# A LaTeX Resume Template

This project is a recreation of a Google Doc resume template in LaTeX that
provides a document class containing environments and commands for programmer's
resumes.

See `resume.pdf` for an example output.

## Getting Started

You can begin writing your own resume with this template by forking this repo
and modifying the contents of `resume.tex`.  Compile the document with your
favorite LaTeX runtime, or use the `Makefile` to compile within a Docker
container using [tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/).

```sh
git clone ...
make
```
